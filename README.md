# PennDOT Dashboard

This is a dashboard I designed for 05-392: Interaction Design Overview.

It visualizes certain pieces of information, where each has a “normal” state and
a “decision required” state. We convey this information using graphics, verbal
language, and animation.

It uses SVGs plus CSS Animations. The SVGs were made using Sketch.

Focus has been placed on clarity of visual design over conciseness and clarity
of the code governing animations.
